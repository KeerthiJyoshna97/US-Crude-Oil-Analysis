📊 Energy Analytics Project – US Crude Oil Import Dashboard Using Power BI

This Power BI project presents a visual exploration of US crude oil import patterns. Through interactive charts and maps, it uncovers vital insights about origin countries, oil grades, volumes, and distribution types—providing a strategic perspective on one of the world’s most critical energy resources.

📁 Project Overview

The dashboard provides a multi-dimensional view of how and where the United States sources crude oil. It leverages quantitative metrics such as total volume, monthly flows, and origin classifications (e.g., Country, Region, OPEC/non-OPEC) to support trend identification and resource planning.

📌 Key Dashboards & Visuals

1. 🌍 Quantity by Origin Type

* Distribution by Country, Region, OPEC/non-OPEC, and Global levels
* Top 10 exporting countries including Canada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and Iraq

2. 🛢️ Crude Oil Grade Breakdown

* Proportions of Heavy Sour, Medium, Light Sweet, and Light Sour grades
* Dominance of Heavy Sour at over 40% of total imports

3. 📈 Monthly Trend Analysis
